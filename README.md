# Running DB2 Express-C in a docker container

## Introduction
These instructions are not intended to show you how to create a DB2 container, but instead instructions for running a DB2 instance with a database in a docker container with pre-installed DB2 Express-C 10.5 Fix Pack 7. 

### Dockerfile.sample
The sample can be used as is to create a sample container without having to modify the Dockerfile. Just copy *Dockerfile.sample* to *Dockerfile* and run docker build. Before doing so, look at the instructions below as a few steps are required to have a running docker container.

### Dockerfile.template
The template contains a number of tags that has to be replaced before you can run docker build. I provided a script to assist with this. The tags that need to be replaced are:
* CONTAINER_LIC   - DB2 license file
* CONTAINER_DB    - DB2 database name for the container
* CONTAINER_PORT  - DB2 instance port for the container
* CONTAINER_PS    - DB2 database pagesize *(4096, 8192, 16384 or 32768)*

### build_dockerfile.sh
This script will build a *Dockerfile* from *Dockerfile.template* based on the arguments you provide to the script. If no arguments are passed to the script, it will print a usage statement with an example.
```
$ ./build_dockerfile.sh 
usage: ./build_dockerfile.sh [-d database_name] [-p port] [-s pagesize] [-l license_file]

 - pagesize is one of: 4096, 8192, 16384 or 32768
 - license_file must be specified without .lic

 example: ./build_dockerfile.sh -d sample -p 50000 -s 8192 -l db2expc_uw
```
Ensure you made the script executable before running it.
```
$ chmod 755 build_dockerfile.sh
```

## Instructions
- Get your hands on *Dockerfile.template*, *Dockerfile.sample (optional)* and *build_dockerfile.sh*
- Place these files in a docker build location of your choice
- You will need to get the license file for DB2 Express-C (use the link below)
 * https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/im/db2express/
- Extract the download and copy the *.lic* file from <download_location>/db2/license to your docker build location
- Your docker location should now consist of the following files:
 * build_dockerfile.sh
 * Dockerfile.template
 * Dockerfile.sample *(optional)*
 * db2expc_uw.lic
- Run *build_dockerfile.sh* to generate the Dockerfile to use for docker build
 * ```$ ./build_dockerfile.sh -d mydb -p 50000 -s 8192 -l db2expc_uw ```
- You should now have a Dockerfile to use for docker build
- Run docker build *(-t, the tag for the container can be anything you want it to be)*
 * ```$ docker build -t db2-express-demo .```
- See *docker_build.out* for expected output from docker build
- Run *docker images*, you should see the new container
 * ```db2-express-demo    latest    eab65833d26f    5 minutes ago    2.395 GB```
- Now do a *docker run* to do initial DB2 configuration and database creation
 * ```docker run --privileged=true -ti db2-express-demo /home/db2inst1/create_db.sh```
- Expected ouput from the above docker run should be similar:

 ```
 DB20000I  The UPDATE DATABASE MANAGER CONFIGURATION command completed successfully.
 DB20000I  The UPDATE DATABASE MANAGER CONFIGURATION command completed successfully.
 SQL1063N  DB2START processing was successful.
 DB20000I  The CREATE DATABASE command completed successfully.
 DB20000I  The UPDATE DATABASE CONFIGURATION command completed successfully.
 ```
- Now run *docker ps -a | grep db2-express-demo* to determine new container id
 * **8401f868ff39**    db2-express-demo    "/home/db2inst1/creat"    5 minutes ago    Exited (0) 5 minutes ago    evil_kilby
- Now run *docker commit* for the new container id
 * ```docker commit 8401f868ff39 db2-express-demo```
- You are now ready to run the container
 * ```docker run --privileged=true -ti -d db2-express-demo su - db2inst1 -c "db2start;bash"```
 * ```--privileged=true``` is required otherwise DB2 will not start
 * ```;bash``` is required otherwise DB2 will start but the container will end immediately afterwords
- If you want to verify if DB2 is running, run *docker exec* as inidicated below
 * Run ```docker ps``` to get the container id
 * Run ```docker exec -ti 8721f88166cd ps -ef |grep db2``` and you should see output similar to:
 
 ```
 root         1     0  0 19:30 ?        00:00:00 su - db2inst1 -c db2start;bash
 db2inst1    12     1  0 19:30 ?        00:00:00 -bash -c db2start;bash
 root       125     1  0 19:30 ?        00:00:00 db2wdog

 root       135   125  0 19:30 ?        00:00:00 db2ckpwd
 db2inst1   137   125  0 19:30 ?        00:00:00 db2vend (PD Vendor Process - 1)
 db2inst1   145   125  0 19:30 ?        00:00:00 db2acd   ,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0002,1,0
 db2inst1   146    12  0 19:30 ?        00:00:00 bash
 ```
- Run ```docker exec -ti 8721f88166cd su - db2inst1 -c "db2 connect to mydb"``` and you should see:
 ```
   Database Connection Information

 Database server        = DB2/LINUXX8664 10.5.7
 SQL authorization ID   = DB2INST1
 Local database alias   = MYDB
 ```
- DB2 is now running in a docker container with an instance and a database
